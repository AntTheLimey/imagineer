# Scenario and Encounter Writing

This document provides guidance for writing RPG scenario and
encounter text that respects player agency and serves the GM as
a reference document. Scenario writing differs fundamentally from
conventional fiction, and this guide covers the principles,
techniques, and anti-patterns that distinguish effective scenario
text from narrative prose.

## Core Principle: Scenarios Are Instruction Manuals

RPG scenarios are instruction manuals for GMs, not stories for
readers. The "show, don't tell" rule of fiction inverts in this
context: the scenario writer tells the GM everything up front.
The villain's plan, NPC motivations, clue connections, timeline,
and possible endings all appear early in the document so the GM
can orchestrate the story for the players. The writer never
withholds information from the GM to create surprise, because the
GM needs complete knowledge to run the scenario effectively.

## Narrative Voice

Scenario text uses two distinct voices: read-aloud text that the
GM speaks to the players, and GM-only text that the GM reads
silently for reference.

### Read-Aloud Text (Boxed Text)

Read-aloud text is visually distinguished from GM-only text using
boxes, shading, or other formatting conventions. The following
guidelines produce effective read-aloud passages:

- Use objective sensory descriptions rather than prescriptive
  actions. Write "The bloated corpse dominates the clearing"
  instead of "You see a corpse and feel uneasy."

- Keep read-aloud passages short, between two and four
  sentences at maximum.

- Describe only what is immediately perceivable through
  sight, sound, smell, and touch. The text never reveals
  hidden information.

- Avoid game-mechanical language such as "stunned" or
  "frightened" in descriptive text.

- Avoid hedging words such as "seems," "appears," or "looks
  like," because these words signal metagaming to experienced
  players.

- Read the text aloud during the writing process to catch
  awkward phrasing.

### Bullet-Point Alternative

Some modern adventures replace boxed text with italicised bullet
points that list sensory details the GM can paraphrase. This
approach gives the GM more flexibility to adapt the description
to the table's mood and the characters' specific perceptions.

### GM-Only Text

All text outside read-aloud passages is for the GM alone. This
text should be scannable during play, because a GM referencing
the scenario mid-session cannot parse dense prose. Use bold
headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make information
easy to find at a glance.

## Player Agency Constraints

The scenario writer cannot place PCs where they do not want to
be. The writer cannot assume what PCs will do, where they will
go, or how they will react. Every scenario must accommodate the
fundamental unpredictability of player decisions.

### Hooks, Not Rails

Effective scenarios provide multiple hooks to draw PCs toward
the core engagement. Hooks can be personal, professional,
curiosity-driven, proximity-based, moral, material, or
threat-based. The writer should include at least three hooks
pointing toward the core engagement, following the same logic
as the Three Clue Rule. The PCs decide whether to bite.

### Conditional Language

Scenario text uses "if X, then Y" constructions rather than
declarative statements about PC actions.

- Write "If the investigators visit the library..." rather
  than "The investigators visit the library..."

- Write "The cultist attacks if cornered, but flees if given
  an escape route" rather than "The cultist attacks the
  party."

### Anti-Patterns (Railroading)

The following table identifies common railroading anti-patterns,
explains why each one is problematic, and offers an alternative.

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Assumed actions | "You rush to help" | "The NPC calls for help" |
| Single-solution | Only one answer works | Multiple valid approaches |
| Floating locations | Any inn has the quest | Real choices with outcomes |
| Illusory choices | All roads lead to same | Distinct paths with content |
| Plot-gated content | Nothing happens off-plot | World advances on its own |
| Forced monologues | Villain explains anyway | PCs must earn information |

### Situation-Based Design

The Alexandrian's "Don't Prep Plots" principle applies directly
to scenario writing. The writer prepares situations consisting of
locations, NPCs, motivations, resources, and threats rather than
sequences of events. The scenario defines what exists in the
world, and the PCs determine what happens during play.

## NPC Approach Patterns

Encounters require NPCs to interact with PCs. The scenario must
still function when PCs do not engage with an NPC as expected.

### Proactive NPCs

The writer designs each significant NPC with five components:

- Goal defines what the NPC wants to achieve.

- Plan describes how the NPC intends to achieve the goal.

- Timeline specifies when the NPC acts if left unopposed.

- Reaction describes how the NPC responds if PCs intervene.

- Escalation describes what happens if PCs do not intervene.

When PCs ignore an NPC, the NPC's plan advances along the
timeline, and the consequences eventually reach the PCs
regardless of their inaction.

### Proactive Clues

When players stall, the scenario provides mechanisms to restart
momentum:

- Someone attempts to kill a PC.

- The villain's plan advances visibly.

- An NPC contacts the PCs with a warning.

- Environmental changes signal that the situation is
  worsening.

### Handling Reluctant PCs

The writer provides multiple strategies for re-engaging PCs who
resist the scenario's hooks:

- Tie hooks to PC backstories.

- Make the problem local so that the situation affects the
  PCs' neighbourhood or allies.

- Offer multiple entry points into the scenario.

- Let NPCs seek the PCs rather than waiting to be found.

- Advance the timeline so the situation worsens with delay.

- Reward engagement visibly to reinforce participation.

## Encounter Text Structure

Well-structured encounter text allows the GM to find information
quickly during play.

### Standard Sections

The following table lists the standard sections of an encounter,
the content each section contains, and the intended audience.

| Section | Content | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| Encounter Title | Name and optional threat level | GM |
| Read-Aloud Text | Sensory description | Players via GM |
| Background | Why this encounter exists | GM |
| NPC Motivations | What each NPC wants, fears, and plans | GM |
| Creatures/Hazards | Stat blocks, tactics, and behaviour | GM |
| Skill Checks | Relevant checks and target numbers | GM |
| Clues/Information | What PCs can discover | GM |
| Possible Outcomes | Success, failure, and flight | GM |
| Treasure/Rewards | Material and narrative rewards | GM |
| Connections | Where this encounter leads next | GM |

### Writing Principles

The following principles produce encounter text that GMs can
use effectively at the table:

- Front-load the essential information. The first paragraph
  answers what is happening, who is present, and what those
  present want.

- Separate immediate facts from contingent facts. Immediate
  facts are always true; contingent facts depend on PC
  actions.

- Specify NPC behaviour rather than dialogue scripts.
  Describe personality, motivation, and key information
  rather than exact words.

- Include failure states for every check or combat. The
  scenario must describe what happens when PCs fail, not
  only when PCs succeed.

### Three-Stage Encounters

Complex encounters benefit from a three-stage structure:

1. Setup establishes the situation and the initial conditions.

2. Complication changes the conditions mid-encounter through
   reinforcements, environmental shifts, revelations, or
   betrayals.

3. Payoff resolves the encounter at maximum stakes.

## Common Pitfalls

Scenario writers encounter recurring problems that undermine
player agency, pacing, and GM usability.

### Assuming PC Actions

The following examples show problematic phrasing alongside
improved alternatives:

- "The PCs enter the cave" becomes "If the PCs enter the
  cave."

- "You feel dread" becomes "The air is cold and damp."

- "The party decides to help" becomes "If the party agrees
  to help."

### Other Pitfalls

- Linear plots create a chain of failure points where a
  single missed clue or failed check halts all progress.
  Use node-based design instead, where self-contained nodes
  contain clues pointing to other nodes and multiple paths
  connect the nodes.

- Gating information behind a single check creates dead
  ends. Use the Three Clue Rule, GUMSHOE automatic core
  clues, or fail-forward mechanics to ensure PCs always
  have a path forward.

- Excessive backstory overwhelms the GM with irrelevant
  history. Place backstory where the GM needs the context,
  and keep the backstory brief.

- Deliberate red herrings waste table time. Players generate
  their own confusion without the writer adding more.

- Hiding GM information by structuring the scenario so the
  GM discovers facts at the same pace as players undermines
  the GM's ability to run the scenario. The GM must know
  everything from the start.

- Scripted NPC dialogue constrains the GM and feels stilted
  at the table. Provide personality, motivation, and key
  information instead of exact dialogue lines.

## System-Specific Conventions

Each supported game system has established conventions for
scenario writing.

### Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition

Call of Cthulhu uses the terms Keeper, Investigator, and
Scenario.

- Sandy Petersen's Onion Layer Structure defines the core
  approach: the surface looks conventional, and each layer
  reveals something more disturbing. The three stages are
  Hint, Clear indication of danger, and The monster.

- Handouts are central to Call of Cthulhu gameplay. The
  writer numbers handouts and designs them as physical
  props.

- Scenarios emphasise investigation and horror over combat.

- Multiple clue paths prevent dead ends in investigation.

- The scenario addresses what happens when investigators
  call the police, because players frequently attempt this
  action.

- NPC stat blocks use the percentile skill format.

### D&D 5th Edition (2024 Revision)

D&D uses the terms Dungeon Master, Character or Adventurer,
and Adventure.

- The 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide defines four steps for
  adventure design: Premise, Draw in players, Plan
  encounters, and End.

- Adventures use three difficulty levels: Low, Moderate, and
  High.

- Location-based structure with numbered areas is the
  standard format.

- Extensive boxed text conventions apply to read-aloud
  passages.

### GURPS 4th Edition

GURPS scenarios prioritise detailed NPC characterisation.

- NPC disadvantages, quirks, and motivations drive the
  scenario forward.

- Multi-sensory descriptions create immersive scenes.

- The writer specifies relevant skills and mechanics for
  each scene.

- The scenario includes debugging guidance for situations
  where PCs deviate from expected paths.

### Forged in the Dark

Forged in the Dark uses the terms Score, Obstacle, and
Scoundrel.

- The Box/House/Target framework structures score design.

- The writer plans obstacles rather than solutions, because
  PCs determine their own approach.

- The engagement roll skips detailed planning, so the
  scenario does not need to anticipate how PCs prepare.

- Flashbacks eliminate the need to anticipate PC plans
  during the score itself.

- Progress clocks track complex obstacles that require
  sustained effort.

- The GM prepares a menu of potential obstacles per zone
  rather than a fixed sequence of events.
