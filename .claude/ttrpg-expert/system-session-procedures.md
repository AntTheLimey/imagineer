# System-Specific Session Procedures

Detailed procedural guidance for running sessions in each game
system Imagineer supports. This supplements the high-level
checklists in gm-session-patterns.md with the specific HOW for
each system's core gameplay loops.

## Call of Cthulhu 7e -- Investigation Sessions

### Investigation Structure Models

**Linear investigations** follow a fixed sequence (A then B then
C). Every transition is a chokepoint where the investigation can
stall. Linear design is fragile and should be avoided beyond
one-shots.

**Node-based investigations** (The Alexandrian model) treat each
location, NPC, or event as a discrete node containing clues that
point to other nodes. Players choose which nodes to visit.

**Building a node-based investigation:**

1. Identify 5-8 nodes (crime scene, library, witness, hideout).
2. For each node, write 2-3 clues pointing to other nodes.
3. Ensure at least three independent paths from opening to
   climax.
4. Apply the Three Clue Rule: for every conclusion investigators
   must reach, prepare at least three supporting clues.

### Investigation Skill Selection

| Skill | Use When |
|-------|----------|
| Spot Hidden (25%) | Noticing physical objects, hidden doors, lurking figures |
| Library Use (20%) | Searching archives, navigating catalogues |
| Listen (20%) | Overhearing conversations, detecting sounds |
| Psychology (10%) | Reading NPC motives, detecting lies |
| Track (10%) | Following physical trails, footprints |
| Appraise (5%) | Determining value, authenticity, origin |

Core clues should be found automatically. Successful skill rolls
reveal additional detail. Failed rolls mean the investigator
finds the clue but misses the extra information.

### Handout Design and Delivery

Handout types ranked by player engagement:

1. Newspaper clippings -- set context, often the opening hook.
2. Letters and correspondence -- reveal NPC relationships.
3. Diary entries -- first-person descent into horror.
4. Maps and floor plans -- drive exploration decisions.
5. Photographs -- establish visual details.
6. Official documents -- provide hard facts.

**Delivery guidelines:**

- Provide public documents freely; these are hooks.
- Gate personal documents behind skill checks or NPC
  interactions.
- Reserve Mythos texts for peak investigation success.
- Limit handouts to 3-5 per session.

### Sanity Pacing

**Session sanity budget:**

| Session Type | SAN Loss | Rationale |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Slow burn / early | 2-5 total | Build unease |
| Mid-scenario | 5-10 total | Risk one bout of madness |
| Climax | 8-15 total | Multiple SAN rolls expected |
| Pulp Cthulhu | Increase by 50% | Higher resilience |

**Pacing principles:**

- Front-load mundane horror before supernatural horror.
- Use at least two escalating events before the major reveal.
- Reserve the largest single SAN loss for the climax.
- No more than three SAN rolls per hour of play.
- Narrate before calling for a roll. Description creates dread;
  the roll creates consequences.

### NPC Interaction Patterns

**Willing witnesses:** Respond to Charm or Persuade. Provide core
clues freely; successful roll reveals sensitive details.

**Reluctant witnesses:** Require establishing trust first. Use
Psychology to identify what the witness fears.

**Hostile witnesses:** Intimidate may extract information but
creates future complications. Fast Talk can bypass hostility.

**Authority figures:** Respond to Credit Rating and credentials.
Credit Rating 50+ accesses official records without a roll.

### Typical CoC Session Flow

1. **Opening hook** (10-15 min): Newspaper, letter, or
   direct encounter.
2. **Initial investigation** (60-90 min): Visit 2-3 nodes,
   gather clues, interview witnesses.
3. **Complication** (15-30 min): Antagonist becomes aware, a
   witness dies, or new layer is revealed.
4. **Escalation** (30-45 min): Investigation narrows. SAN
   checks increase.
5. **Confrontation** (30-45 min): Climactic encounter.
6. **Resolution/Escape** (15-20 min): Aftermath and hooks.

## D&D 5e -- Adventure Sessions

### Combat Encounter Design

**2024 XP Budget per character:**

| Level | Low | Moderate | High |
|-------|-----|----------|------|
| 1 | 50 | 75 | 100 |
| 3 | 150 | 225 | 400 |
| 5 | 500 | 750 | 1,100 |
| 10 | 2,000 | 3,000 | 4,500 |
| 15 | 5,000 | 7,500 | 11,500 |
| 20 | 14,000 | 20,000 | 30,000 |

Multiply by number of characters for total encounter budget.

**Lazy DM Deadly Benchmark (Sly Flourish):**

- Levels 1-4: Deadly when total monster CR exceeds one quarter
  of total character levels.
- Levels 5+: Deadly when total monster CR exceeds one half of
  total character levels.

**When to use each difficulty:**

- **Low:** Warmup, attrition, random encounters.
- **Moderate:** Standard planned combats.
- **High:** Boss fights, climactic set pieces.

### Action-Oriented Monsters (Colville Method)

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Double or triple HP | Fight lasts 3+ rounds |
| 2 | Round 1 Villain Action | Positioning |
| 3 | Round 2 Villain Action | Escape/reposition |
| 4 | Round 3 Villain Action | Devastating burst |
| 5 | Add Legendary Resistances | Prevent early shutdown |

Villain actions trigger at end of a round, not on the monster's
turn.

### Exploration Procedures

**Dungeon exploration checklist:**

1. Establish marching order and light sources.
2. Per room: describe entrances, features, ambient details.
3. Perception checks only when something is hidden.
4. Track time in 10-minute exploration turns.
5. Use passive Perception for traps.

**Wilderness travel:**

| Pace | Speed (6-mile hex/day) | Effect |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| Slow | 3 hexes | Advantage on navigation; Stealth |
| Normal | 4 hexes | Standard |
| Fast | 5 hexes | -5 passive Perception |

### Social Encounter Structure

**NPC Attitude System (2024):**

| Attitude | DC Modifier |
|----------|------------|
| Hostile | Disadvantage |
| Unfriendly | +5 to DC |
| Indifferent | No modifier |
| Friendly | -5 to DC |
| Helpful | Advantage |

**Skill Challenge Framework (4e legacy):**

1. Set the goal.
2. Complexity: (2 x party size) successes before (party size)
   failures.
3. DC by tier: 10 easy, 15 moderate, 20 hard.
4. No skill used more than twice per challenge.
5. Narrate each success and failure.

### Typical D&D 5e Session Flow

1. **Recap** (5 min): Player-given summary.
2. **Strong start** (10-15 min): Immediate action or tension.
3. **Discovery/exploration** (45-60 min): Dungeons, wilderness,
   or investigation.
4. **Challenge** (45-60 min): Combat, social, or environmental.
5. **Revelation** (10-15 min): Secret found, story advances.
6. **Cliffhanger** (5 min): End at maximum tension.

## GURPS 4e -- Flexible Sessions

### Combat Resolution Tiers

| Tier | Name | When to Use |
|------|------|-------------|
| Quick | Single roll | Mook encounters |
| Basic | Turn-by-turn, no map | Most fights |
| Tactical | Full rules, map | Boss fights, set pieces |

### Basic Combat Maneuvers

| Maneuver | Effect | Defenses |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Attack | Roll vs skill to hit | Dodge, Parry, Block |
| All-Out Attack | +4 to hit, or two attacks | None this turn |
| All-Out Defense | +2 to one defense | Full |
| Aim | +Accuracy on next ranged attack | Full, lost if damaged |
| Evaluate | +1 to next melee attack (max +3) | Full |
| Feint | Quick Contest; penalises defence | Full |
| Move and Attack | Full move, attack at -4 | Dodge only |
| Wait | Interrupt on trigger | Full |

**Simplification strategies:**

- Skip hit locations unless dramatically important.
- Apply -1 per complicating factor instead of table lookups.
- Enforce 5-second decision timer.
- Use BAD (Basic Abstract Difficulty) for non-combat modifiers.

### Skill Challenge Design

**Quick Contest** (instantaneous opposed actions): Both roll
3d6 vs skill. Higher margin of success wins.

**Regular Contest** (prolonged): Both roll each round. Victory
only when one succeeds AND the other fails.

**Complementary skills:** Assistant rolls related skill. Success
gives +1 to primary roll. Critical success gives +2.

### Character Advancement

| Campaign Style | CP/Session | Effect |
|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Gritty | 1-2 | Slow growth |
| Standard | 3-5 | Steady improvement |
| Cinematic | 5-8 | Rapid growth |

### Typical GURPS Session Flow (by Genre)

**Action:**
Briefing -> Planning -> Infiltration -> Tactical encounter ->
Extraction.

**Investigation:**
Hook -> Research -> Fieldwork -> Confrontation -> Resolution.

**Social/Political:**
Situation briefing -> Networking -> The event -> Complications ->
Aftermath.

## Blades in the Dark -- Score and Downtime

### The Core Loop

```
Free Play -> Score Setup -> Engagement Roll -> Score Execution
    -> Payoff & Heat -> Downtime -> Entanglements -> Free Play
```

### Score Setup

**Six Plan Types:**

| Plan | Detail Required | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Assault | Point of attack | "Front gate at midnight" |
| Deception | Method | "Disguised as inspectors" |
| Stealth | Point of infiltration | "Through the sewers" |
| Occult | Arcane method | "Using the ghost key" |
| Social | Connection | "Lord Strangford's invitation" |
| Transport | Route and means | "Gondola through Nightmarket" |

Do not over-plan. The plan type and detail are sufficient.
Flashbacks handle everything else.

### Engagement Roll

Build a dice pool starting from 1d:

| Factor | Modifier |
|--------|----------|
| Bold or daring plan | +1d |
| Complex or risky plan | -1d |
| Detail provides advantage | +1d |
| Detail is weak | -1d |
| Friendly faction assists | +1d |
| Enemy faction interferes | -1d |
| Target is higher Tier | -1d |

| Result | Opening Position |
|--------|-----------------|
| Critical | Controlled; first obstacle overcome |
| 6 | Controlled |
| 4-5 | Risky |
| 1-3 | Desperate |

### Flashback Mechanics

| Stress Cost | Situation |
|------------|-----------|
| 0 | Ordinary action, easy opportunity |
| 1 | Complex or unlikely action |
| 2+ | Elaborate action, special contingencies |

**Rules:**

- Cannot undo established fictional facts.
- CAN recontextualize established facts.
- Flashbacks involving downtime cost 1 coin or 1 rep.
- Failed rolls in flashbacks produce present consequences.

**Preventing overuse:** Stress is self-limiting (max 9). Raise
cost to 2 if flashbacks trivialise every problem.

### Clock Management

**When to create clocks vs single rolls:**

- Single roll: immediate, binary outcome.
- 4 segments: moderate complexity.
- 6 segments: complex, multi-step.
- 8 segments: long or difficult.

**Clock types:**

| Type | Visibility | Advances When |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Progress | Visible | PCs succeed |
| Danger | Usually visible | Consequences, failures, time |
| Racing | Both visible | Both sides act |
| Faction | Hidden | Between sessions |

### Devil's Bargain

A bonus die in exchange for a complication regardless of roll
outcome. Common bargains:

- Collateral damage or harm.
- Sacrifice coin or an item.
- Offend a faction.
- Start or tick a troublesome clock.
- Add heat from evidence.

### Downtime Phase

**Heat gain:**

| Situation | Heat |
|-----------|------|
| Smooth operation | 0-2 |
| Noisy operation | 3-4 |
| Involved killing | +2 |
| High-profile target | +2 |
| Hostile turf | +1 |

**Downtime activities (two free per PC):**

| Activity | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Acquire Asset | Gain item at Tier quality |
| Long-Term Project | Tick project clock |
| Recover | Heal harm |
| Reduce Heat | Lower heat |
| Train | Mark 1 xp |
| Indulge Vice | Clear stress |

### Typical Blades Session Flow

1. **Free play** (15-20 min): Roleplay, gather information.
2. **Score setup** (5-10 min): Target, plan type, detail.
3. **Engagement roll** (2 min): Opening position.
4. **Score execution** (60-90 min): Actions, flashbacks, clocks.
5. **Payoff and heat** (5 min): Rewards and consequences.
6. **Downtime** (20-30 min): Two activities per PC.
7. **Faction updates** (between sessions): Advance clocks.
