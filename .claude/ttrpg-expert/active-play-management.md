# Active Play Management

Techniques and frameworks for managing TTRPG sessions during
active play. This document complements gm-session-patterns.md,
which covers pre-session prep and post-session practices.

## Real-Time Note-Taking

### What to Record

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Player decisions | Chose to spare the cultist, refused the deal |
| Improvised NPCs | Name, role, quirk, location encountered |
| Locations visited | New areas explored, details described |
| Clues found | Evidence discovered, connections made |
| Combat outcomes | Who was injured, resources spent |
| Player reactions | What excited or bored the table |
| Timeline events | In-game dates, durations, deadlines |
| Quotes | Memorable player or NPC dialogue |

### Shorthand Techniques

- Underline all proper nouns for easy scanning.
- Standard abbreviations: PC, N (NPC), L (location), C (clue),
  F (faction), ? (unresolved), ! (important), -> (leads to),
  X (dead/destroyed).
- Use index cards with pre-printed templates for improvised NPCs
  (name, motivation, quirk, location).
- Record actions, not descriptions. Write "PCs bribed guard,
  entered warehouse" not lengthy narrative.

### Tracking Player Knowledge

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Unknown | Players have no knowledge |
| Rumoured | Players heard about it |
| Observed | Players witnessed it directly |
| Investigated | Players actively studied it |
| Understood | Players grasp significance |

Track what each individual PC knows versus what the group knows.

### Note-Taking Without Breaking Flow

- Take notes during player discussions, not during your own
  narration or when a player is speaking to you directly.
- At session end, ask players to recap what happened. What they
  remember reveals what matters to them.
- Review notes within 48 hours. Expand shorthand and flag items
  for follow-up.

## Improvisation Frameworks

### The Response Framework

| Response | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Yes, and | Accept and expand | "Yes, the door is unlocked, and you hear voices" |
| Yes, but | Accept with complication | "Yes, you pick the lock, but noise alerts someone" |
| No, but | Deny with alternative | "The wall is too high, but there's a drainage grate" |
| No, and | Deny and escalate (rare) | "The spell fails, and the backlash draws attention" |

Default to "Yes, but" when uncertain.

### Improv NPC Generation

When an unplanned NPC is needed, define three elements:

1. **Name.** Pull from a pre-prepared list of setting-appropriate
   names. Keep 20-30 names ready.
2. **Motivation.** What does this NPC want right now? One of:
   safety, wealth, power, knowledge, revenge, loyalty, freedom,
   comfort, recognition, or love.
3. **Quirk.** One memorable detail: a speech pattern, nervous
   habit, distinctive clothing, or unusual possession.

Record the NPC immediately. An unrecorded improvised NPC will be
forgotten and create continuity errors.

### Fail Forward / Success at a Cost

When a player fails a roll, avoid "nothing happens" outcomes.

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Succeed at a cost | Get what you want, lose something | Pick the lock but break the lockpick |
| Partial information | Learn something but not everything | Find the letter but it is partially burned |
| Delayed consequence | Success now, trouble later | Escape but the guard remembers your face |
| Resource drain | Success costs HP, stress, ammo, or time | Climb the wall but take fatigue |
| Complication | New problem from the attempt | Open the safe but trigger a silent alarm |
| Worse position | The situation deteriorates | The suspect clams up and becomes hostile |

### The Rule of Cool

Allow a dramatic creative action outside strict rules if:

- It creates a memorable moment for the table.
- It does not trivialise the challenge entirely.
- It does not undermine another player's contribution.
- The player accepts potential consequences.

Use sparingly. Overuse removes stakes.

## Spotlight Management

### Rotation Techniques

- **Round-Robin Check-Ins.** After resolving a scene, ask each
  player: "What is your character doing?"
- **Ability Spotlighting.** Design encounters that require each
  character's strengths.
- **Background Spotlighting.** Tie story threads to individual
  character histories.
- **Goal Spotlighting.** Build scenes around personal objectives.

### Handling Dominant Players

- Set explicit table rules: "Let everyone respond before jumping
  in."
- Use direct address: "What does [quiet character] think?"
- Speak privately between sessions. Frame positively.

### Engaging Quiet Players

- Offer closed choices: "Do you follow the stranger or stay?"
- Create NPC connections to their backstory.
- Provide written notes addressed to their character.
- Recognise some players enjoy watching. Ensure they have the
  option to engage, not the obligation.

### Split Party Management

- Cut between groups frequently (5-10 minutes maximum).
- Use cliffhangers when cutting away.
- Let the non-active group play NPCs in the other scene.
- Use visible progress clocks for parallel time pressure.

## Pacing and Flow

### Reading the Table

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Phones out | Boredom | Speed up, introduce action |
| Crosstalk | Scene dragging | Cut to next scene |
| Leaning forward | High engagement | Let the moment breathe |
| Rules arguments | Frustration | Make a ruling, move on |
| Laughter/quotes | Fun | Note what caused it |
| Silence after reveal | Processing | Pause, let it land |
| Side conversations | Lost interest | Refocus with direct address |

### When to Roll vs Narrate

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Outcome is uncertain and interesting | Roll |
| Failure would stop the story | Narrate success, maybe with cost |
| Task is trivial for the character | Narrate success |
| Task is impossible | Narrate failure or offer alternative |
| Player proposes creative solution | Lower difficulty or grant advantage |

### Managing Combat Length

- Use average damage for monsters instead of rolling.
- Reduce monster HP secretly if combat is dragging.
- Introduce a timer that forces resolution.
- Group identical enemies on a single initiative.
- Enforce turn time limits (30-60 seconds).
- Remove morale-broken enemies narratively.

### Session Clock Management

| Act | Purpose | Time Share |
|-----|---------|------------|
| Opening | Recap, strong start, initial scene | 15-20% |
| Middle | Core encounters, exploration, roleplay | 55-65% |
| Closing | Climax, denouement, cliffhanger | 20-25% |

Set a real-world alarm 30 minutes before session end.

### Tension Techniques

- Countdown clocks that advance on failures.
- Real-time pressure (60 seconds to decide).
- Sensory escalation (sounds, smells, temperature).
- NPC urgency.
- Short, clipped sentences for urgency. Long descriptions for
  building dread.

## Mid-Session Adjustments

### Adjusting Encounter Difficulty

| Technique | Harder | Easier |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Hit points | +10-25% | -10-25% |
| Reinforcements | Add waves | Enemies flee |
| Tactics | Coordinate, flank | Act foolishly |
| Environment | Add hazards | Add cover |
| Morale | Fight to death | Surrender early |
| Objectives | Add secondary goals | Simplify |

Adjust one variable at a time.

### The Quantum Ogre (Use With Caution)

Move prepared content to where players go. Acceptable when the
location is not meaningful. Harmful when players specifically
chose to avoid it. Overuse destroys player agency.

### Pivoting When a Scene Falls Flat

- **Interrupt.** An explosion, messenger, or attack redirects.
- **Escalate.** Raise the stakes so the scene becomes urgent.
- **Time Skip.** Jump to the next interesting moment.
- **Ask the players.** "What are you hoping to accomplish?"

### Emergency Content Generation

1. Return to an unresolved thread from a previous session.
2. Introduce a complication from an existing faction.
3. Have an established NPC arrive with urgent news.
4. Use a random encounter table.
5. Call a short break and plan.

## Player Decision Tracking

### Decision Log Structure

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Session | Which session the decision occurred in |
| Description | What the players chose to do |
| Alternatives | What they chose not to do |
| Affected Entities | NPCs, factions, locations impacted |
| Consequence Type | Immediate, short-term, long-term |
| Resolved | Whether the consequence has played out |

### Faction Reaction Tracking

| Player Action | Faction | Reaction | Timeline |
|---------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Stole from warehouse | Docks Gang | Hostile, seeking PCs | Next session |
| Rescued merchant | Merchant Guild | Grateful, offers aid | Ongoing |
| Ignored plea | City Watch | Neutral, noted | Long-term |

### Memorable Moments Log

- Heroic acts and critical successes.
- Dramatic failures and consequences.
- Memorable NPC interactions.
- Player-driven plot twists.
- Humorous moments and quotes.

## System-Specific Play Management

### Call of Cthulhu 7e

**Investigation pacing:**

- Apply the Three Clue Rule. Core clues are found automatically;
  skill rolls reveal bonus information.
- Do not plan red herrings. Players generate their own.
- If stuck, introduce a proactive event.

**Sanity spiral management:**

- Space SAN-threatening encounters throughout the session.
- Track each investigator's SAN relative to breaking point.
- Make temporary insanity dramatic but time-limited.
- Allow recovery scenes between horrors.

**Keeper screen essentials:**

- Resistance table, chase rules, sanity loss values.
- Investigator SAN, HP, and Luck totals.
- Current in-game date and time.

### GURPS 4e

**Simplified combat for speed:**

- Use range bands: Close (0-2yd, no penalty), Near (3-5yd, -2),
  Far (6-10yd, -4), Distant (11+yd, -6).
- Skip hit locations unless dramatically important.
- Use a single environmental modifier instead of tallying.
- Enforce a 5-second decision timer per turn.

**Skill challenge adjudication:**

- Routine tasks: one roll, move on.
- Dramatic tasks: quick contest or three escalating rolls.
- Complementary skills: success on related skill gives +1.

### Forged in the Dark

**Clock management during scores:**

- Run parallel clocks: player progress and mounting danger.
- Fill danger segments on mixed success (4-5) results.
- Only create clocks where gradual progress matters.
- Make clocks visible to players.

**Engagement roll tips:**

- Cut directly to the action after the roll.
- Poor rolls mean immediate complications, not failure.
- Encourage flashback spending.

**Downtime pacing:**

- Allocate 30-45 minutes for downtime.
- Do not skip it; downtime is where players set goals.
- Use entanglement results to generate next score hooks.

### D&D 5e

**Combat management:**

- Use average monster damage to speed up rounds.
- Track concentration spells with visible tokens.
- Group identical monsters on shared initiative.
- End fights when outcome is decided; enemies flee or surrender.

**Skill challenges (4e legacy):**

- Set success threshold: 2 x party size successes before party
  size failures.
- No skill used more than twice per challenge.
- Narrate each success and failure for dramatic tension.
