# RPG Terminology

Comprehensive terminology reference for tabletop roleplaying games.

## Core RPG Roles

Tabletop RPGs involve several fundamental roles that appear across all game
systems, though the specific terminology varies.

### Game Master (GM)

The GM facilitates the game, controlling the world and all non-player
characters. The GM describes scenes, adjudicates rules, and responds to
player actions. This role exists in every TTRPG, though different systems
use different names for the position.

### Player

A player participates in the game by controlling a character. Players make
decisions for their characters, describe their characters' actions, and
interact with the world the GM presents. Most TTRPGs require three to six
players for optimal play.

### Player Character (PC)

A PC is a character controlled by a player. The PC serves as the player's
avatar in the fictional world. Players create their PCs before play begins,
defining characteristics, background, and abilities according to the game
system's rules.

### Non-Player Character (NPC)

An NPC is any character not controlled by a player. The GM portrays all
NPCs, from minor shopkeepers to major antagonists. NPCs populate the game
world and provide interaction opportunities for the PCs.

### Party

The party is the group of PCs working together. Most TTRPGs assume the PCs
form a cooperative group with shared goals. Some systems call this group
a crew, coterie, or band.

## System-Specific GM Titles

Different game systems use different titles for the Game Master role. The
following table maps common titles to their associated games.

| Title | Abbreviation | Game Systems |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Game Master | GM | GURPS, generic term |
| Dungeon Master | DM | D&D, D20 System games |
| Keeper of Arcane Lore | Keeper | Call of Cthulhu |
| Storyteller | ST | World of Darkness (Vampire, Werewolf) |
| Master of Ceremonies | MC | Powered by the Apocalypse games |
| Referee | Ref | OSR games, older editions |
| Judge | Judge | Dungeon Crawl Classics |
| Director | Director | Some narrative games |
| Narrator | Narrator | Some indie RPGs |
| Warden | Warden | Mausritter, Cairn |
| Facilitator | Facilitator | Some collaborative games |

### Usage Notes

When communicating with users, Imagineer uses the generic term "GM" to
maintain system-agnostic language. However, the TTRPG expert agent should
recognize all these titles as referring to the same fundamental role.

## Common RPG Terms

These terms appear across most tabletop RPGs regardless of system.

### Session

A session is a single play meeting where players gather to play the game.
Sessions typically last two to four hours. Players track events that occur
during each session for continuity.

### Campaign

A campaign is a connected series of sessions telling an ongoing story. The
same characters persist across sessions, and events from earlier sessions
affect later play. Campaigns can last months or years.

### Adventure, Module, and Scenario

These terms describe a complete story arc within a campaign.

- An adventure is a self-contained story with beginning, middle, and end.
- A module is a published adventure, often with maps and stat blocks.
- A scenario is commonly used in Call of Cthulhu for a single investigation.

### One-Shot

A one-shot is a complete game played in a single session. Players often use
pre-generated characters for one-shots. One-shots work well for trying new
systems or playing with variable groups.

### Setting and World

The setting or world is the fictional universe where the game takes place.
Settings include geography, history, cultures, and metaphysics. Some games
have official settings, while others expect the GM to create a custom world.

### Lore and Canon

Lore encompasses the established facts about a setting. Canon refers to
information officially accepted as true within the fictional world. GMs
track lore to maintain consistency across sessions.

### Homebrew

Homebrew describes custom content created by the GM or players. Homebrew
can include new rules, settings, creatures, or modifications to existing
material. Homebrew content is not official but allows customization.

### RAW and RAI

RAW (Rules As Written) refers to the literal text of game rules. RAI
(Rules As Intended) refers to how designers meant rules to work. These
terms arise when rule text is ambiguous or produces unexpected outcomes.

### House Rules

House rules are modifications a specific gaming group makes to the official
rules. Groups adopt house rules to fix perceived problems or customize the
experience. House rules apply only at that particular table.

## Character-Related Terms

These terms describe elements of player characters across different systems.

### Backstory

A backstory is a character's history before play begins. Players create
backstories to inform their character's motivations and relationships.
Backstories often provide plot hooks for the GM.

### Stats and Attributes

Stats or attributes are numerical values representing a character's innate
capabilities. Common attributes include strength, intelligence, and
dexterity. Different systems use different attribute sets and scales.

### Skills

Skills represent trained capabilities a character has developed. Characters
use skills to attempt specific actions like picking locks, persuading NPCs,
or researching information. Most systems tie skill values to base
attributes.

### Traits and Feats

Traits and feats are special abilities that modify how a character operates.
Traits often describe personality or background elements. Feats typically
grant specific mechanical benefits. GURPS calls these advantages and
disadvantages.

### Level, Rank, and Experience

These terms describe character progression systems.

- Level indicates overall character power in class-based systems.
- Rank measures advancement within an organization or path.
- Experience points (XP) track progress toward advancement.

### Class and Archetype

A class or archetype defines a character's role and available abilities.
Classes include traditional fantasy roles like fighter, wizard, and rogue.
Some systems use playbooks or templates instead of classes.

### Race, Species, and Ancestry

These terms describe a character's biological origin. Traditional games used
"race" for elves, dwarves, and similar fantasy peoples. Modern games often
prefer "species" or "ancestry" as more accurate terminology.

## Gameplay Terms

These terms describe mechanical elements of play.

### Roll, Check, and Test

A roll, check, or test occurs when a player uses dice to determine an
outcome. The GM calls for a roll when an action's success is uncertain.
Different systems use different dice and resolution mechanics.

### DC and TN

DC (Difficulty Class) or TN (Target Number) represents the number a player
must meet or exceed for success. The GM sets the DC based on the task's
difficulty. Higher DCs indicate harder tasks.

### Modifier and Bonus

A modifier or bonus is a number added to or subtracted from a die roll.
Modifiers come from character abilities, situational factors, or equipment.
The final result equals the roll plus all applicable modifiers.

### Critical Success and Failure

A critical success is an exceptional positive result, often from a specific
die outcome. A critical failure (or fumble) is an exceptional negative
result. Critical results typically produce effects beyond normal success
or failure.

### Initiative

Initiative determines turn order during structured time. Players roll
initiative at the start of combat or other time-sensitive situations.
Higher initiative results act before lower results.

### Round and Turn

A round is one complete cycle where all participants act once. A turn is
one participant's action within a round. Combat proceeds in rounds until
the conflict resolves.

### Combat and Encounter

Combat is structured conflict between characters using the game's fighting
rules. An encounter is any significant scene requiring mechanical
resolution. Not all encounters involve combat; social and exploration
encounters also exist.

### Rest and Downtime

Rest and downtime are periods when characters recover resources. Short rests
restore minor resources. Long rests or downtime periods allow major recovery
and personal activities.

## Imagineer Terminology Choices

### Canon Confidence Levels

Imagineer tracks the reliability of campaign information.

### System Translation

When users employ system-specific terminology, Imagineer translates to
standard terms internally while preserving the original language in user-
facing content. For example, a Call of Cthulhu user might refer to "Keeper
Notes," but Imagineer stores the data as GM Notes.
