# Scene and Encounter Structure Patterns

Practical patterns for designing, framing, and running scenes and
encounters across TTRPG systems. This document covers scene types,
framing techniques, encounter design principles, pacing, and
system-specific patterns.

## Scene Types and Templates

### Combat Encounters

Combat scenes pit characters against hostile forces. Effective
combat encounters go beyond stat blocks and challenge ratings.

**Setup Checklist:**

- Define the objective beyond "kill all enemies" (protect an NPC,
  hold a position, escape, retrieve an object, stop a ritual).
- Establish the environment with interactive elements: cover,
  elevation, hazards, chokepoints, darkness, difficult terrain.
- Give enemies a motivation and a plan. Enemies want something
  and act intelligently toward that goal.
- Determine what happens if the PCs lose, flee, or negotiate.

**Running Principles:**

- Enemies use tactics: ranged attackers stay at range, brutes
  close distance, spellcasters protect themselves with minions.
- The environment changes during combat: fires spread, supports
  collapse, reinforcements arrive, weather shifts.
- End combat when the outcome is decided, not when every enemy
  reaches zero HP. Enemies surrender, flee, or regroup.

**Resolution:**

- Consequences follow from the fight: noise draws attention,
  injuries limit future actions, alliances shift.
- Loot and information emerge naturally from the scene.

### Social Encounters

Social scenes involve negotiation, persuasion, deception, or
information gathering through conversation.

**Structure:**

1. Establish the NPC's goal, personality, and disposition.
2. Present the stakes: what the PCs want and what the NPC wants.
3. Allow multiple approaches: charm, intimidation, bribery,
   deception, appeal to shared interest.
4. Track disposition shifts during the conversation rather than
   resolving everything in a single roll.

**Key Techniques:**

- Give NPCs a "price" they will accept and a "line" they will
  not cross. This creates negotiation space.
- Social encounters should change the world state: alliances
  form, information flows, favours are owed.
- Allow partial success. An NPC might share some information
  but withhold a critical detail.

### Investigation Scenes

Investigation scenes are the backbone of mystery-driven games.
The core challenge is interpretation of clues, not finding them.

**The Three Clue Rule (The Alexandrian):**

For any conclusion PCs need to reach, include at least three
clues. Players will miss the first, ignore the second, and
misinterpret the third.

**Clue Types:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Passive | Found through searching | Letter in a desk |
| Reactive | Require specific action | Asking the right question |
| Dynamic | Created on the fly by GM | Improvised based on play |
| Proactive | Come to the PCs directly | An assassin attacks |

**Anti-Patterns:**

- Never gate progress behind a single skill check.
- Never include scenes that look like investigation but reveal
  nothing.
- Avoid red herrings. Players generate their own false leads.

**Fail Forward:** When a skill check fails, the PCs still get
the information but with a complication: they are noticed, it
takes longer, they get a partial version, or they arrive at the
next location already in trouble.

### Exploration Scenes

**Description Techniques:**

- Use three distinctive sensory details per location: what they
  see, hear, and smell or feel.
- Describe what is unusual or different, not the mundane.
- Let players ask questions to uncover more detail rather than
  front-loading narration.

**Pacing:**

- Montage through empty or safe areas.
- Slow down for discovery: a hidden chamber, a strange
  inscription, an unexpected vista.
- Use random encounters sparingly and only when they advance
  the story or build tension.

### Downtime Scenes

Downtime handles what happens between adventures: healing,
crafting, training, socialising, and personal projects.

- Give players structured choices: spend time, money, or social
  capital.
- Connect downtime to ongoing narrative. Training with a mentor
  builds a relationship.
- Ask character-driven questions: "What does your character do
  when they can't sleep?"

### Chase Scenes

- Keep chases short: 3-4 rounds typical, 6-7 for a long one.
- The environment is the real adversary. Obstacles, crowds,
  terrain changes create the drama.
- Give both sides meaningful choices each round.
- Use progress clocks or distance tracks to visualise the gap.
- End the chase when the gap closes or opens decisively.

### Puzzle and Trap Scenes

**Puzzles:**

- Provide multiple solution paths.
- Include environmental clues pointing toward the solution.
- Set a time pressure or consequence for delay.

**Traps:**

- Traps should be discoverable and disarmable.
- The best traps force choices: disarm slowly and safely, or
  rush through and accept the risk.

## Scene Framing Techniques

### Opening a Scene

**Identify the Agenda.** Every scene exists to answer a question
or resolve a situation. If you cannot state the agenda, the
scene may not need to exist.

**Deliver the Bang.** The bang is the catalyst that demands a
response. Cut as close to the moment of decision as possible.

**Cut In Late.** Skip travel, small talk, and logistics unless
they are the scene. Start mid-argument inside the tavern, not
walking toward it.

### Ending a Scene

**Cut On Resolution.** End the scene within one minute of the
agenda being resolved.

**Cut On the Second Lull.** The first lull is often a pivot. The
second signals the scene has run its course.

**Use Cliffhangers.** End at maximum tension, before the
resolution is known.

**The Ken Hite Signal.** When players have extracted all available
information, signal it clearly.

### Transitions Between Scenes

| Type | Description | Use When |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Slow Time | Real time exceeds game time | Extended contests |
| Now Time | Real time matches game time | Standard play |
| Abstract Time | "Several days pass..." | Bridging scenes |
| Sharp Cut | Jump directly to next action | Maximum momentum |

### When to Call a Scene Break

- The agenda is resolved and no new agenda has emerged.
- The energy in the room has dropped noticeably.
- A dramatic moment has peaked.
- The focus needs to shift to different characters.

## Encounter Design Principles

### Situation-Based Design (Sly Flourish)

Design situations, not scenes. A situation lays out components
that create a scene when characters interact with it.

**Situation Checklist:**

1. **Location** - Multiple paths and exploration rewards.
2. **Inhabitants** - Mix creature types. Include friendly NPCs.
3. **Behaviours** - Activity patterns independent of players.
4. **Goal** - The characters' primary objective.
5. **Complications** - 2-3 potential complications.

### The Monsters Know What They're Doing

Every creature has a motivation: what it wants, what it fears,
and what it will do to survive.

- Creatures defending territory use the environment: chokepoints,
  elevation, darkness, cover.
- Boss monsters surround themselves with minions that fill
  tactical roles the boss lacks.

### Action-Oriented Encounter Design

Boss encounters follow a three-round dramatic arc with "villain
actions" keyed to rounds.

| Round | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Position | Boss leaps to high ground |
| 2 | Escape | Boss burrows underground, summons minions |
| 3 | Explode | Multi-target devastating attack |

**Difficulty Adjustment Dials:**

| Dial | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Hit Points | Halve or double |
| Monster Count | Add reinforcements or allow retreat |
| Damage | Increase or decrease |
| Attack Frequency | Extra attacks for solo bosses |

### Multi-Stage Encounters

**Three-Stage Framework:**

1. **Setup** - Establish threat and environment.
2. **Complication** - Reinforcements, environmental shift,
   revelation, or betrayal.
3. **Payoff** - Stakes are highest, outcome is decisive.

**Escalation Techniques:**

- The arena changes: floor collapses, water rises, fire spreads.
- New information emerges that changes the moral calculus.
- The boss shifts forms, tactics, or abilities between stages.

## Node-Based Scenario Design (The Alexandrian)

Scenarios are organised around interconnected nodes rather than
linear sequences.

### Node Types

| Type | Description | Clue Mechanism |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Location | A place to visit | Search the area |
| Person | An individual to interact with | Interrogation |
| Organisation | A group | Investigate members |
| Event | An occurrence | Attend or witness |
| Activity | A task to perform | Complete the task |

### Connecting Nodes

Each node contains clues pointing to other nodes. Apply the Three
Clue Rule at the node level: each node should be reachable via at
least three clues from other nodes.

### The Inverted Three Clue Rule

If PCs have access to any three clues across all nodes, they will
reach at least one valid conclusion. Design clue density to ensure
this threshold is met regardless of which nodes PCs visit.

## Pacing Within Scenes

### When to Speed Up

- Montage through routine actions.
- Skip to the interesting part when no meaningful choices remain.
- Batch similar actions.
- Summarise known outcomes.

### When to Slow Down

- A player is making a dramatic character decision.
- The scene involves a significant revelation.
- Combat reaches a turning point.
- An NPC interaction has emotional weight.

### Spotlight Management

- Rotate focus deliberately after resolving each PC's moment.
- Track who has not spoken recently and create openings.
- During split-party scenes, cut between groups at tension, not
  resolution.

### Improv Response Framework

| Response | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Yes, and | Accept and expand | "Yes, the wall is climbable, and you notice a window" |
| Yes, but | Accept with complication | "Yes, you pick the lock, but it triggers an alarm" |
| No, but | Deny with alternative | "The door is sealed, but there's a ventilation shaft" |
| No, and | Deny and escalate (rare) | "The spell fails, and the backlash alerts guards" |

## Practical Checklists

### Scene Design Checklist

1. State the scene's agenda in one sentence.
2. Identify who is present and what they want.
3. Choose the opening technique (cut in late, bang, threshold).
4. List 2-3 possible outcomes.
5. Prepare the closing trigger.

### Encounter Design Checklist

1. Define the objective beyond "defeat all enemies."
2. Design the environment with 3 interactive elements.
3. Give each enemy a motivation and basic tactical plan.
4. Prepare a complication for mid-encounter.
5. Determine consequences of success, failure, and flight.
6. Set difficulty using system-appropriate benchmarks.

### Investigation Scene Checklist

1. State the conclusion PCs should reach.
2. Write at least three clues pointing to that conclusion.
3. Place clues across at least two different nodes.
4. Include one proactive clue that comes to the PCs.
5. Prepare a fail-forward result for each skill-gated clue.
