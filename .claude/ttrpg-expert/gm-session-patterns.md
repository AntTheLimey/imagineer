# GM Session Patterns

This document captures common patterns GMs use for organizing campaigns,
preparing sessions, and maintaining continuity across game systems.

## Campaign Content Structures

### Hierarchical Organization

Experienced GMs organize campaigns using a hierarchical structure similar to
television series. The following table shows the typical levels.

| Level | Description | Typical Duration |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Campaign | The entire ongoing story | Months to years |
| Arc/Season | A series of related adventures | 3-12 sessions |
| Adventure/Chapter | A complete storyline | 1-4 sessions |
| Session | A single play session | 3-5 hours |
| Scene/Encounter | A discrete gameplay moment | 15-60 minutes |

Sessions represent player-facing units (when the group meets), while
adventures represent narrative units (story beats). These rarely align
perfectly, and experienced GMs plan for adventures to span multiple sessions.

### Campaign Metadata

GMs track essential metadata for each campaign.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Name | The campaign title |
| Description | A brief overview of the campaign |
| Game System | The rules being used, including house rules |
| Setting | The world, time period, and location |
| Tone | The style (comedic, serious, horror, pulp) |
| Lethality | How deadly the game is |
| Start Date | The in-game starting date |
| Player Count | The number of active players |
| Schedule | The frequency and typical session duration |
| Custom Rules | Any house rules or optional mechanics |

## Session Prep Frameworks

### The Lazy DM Framework

Mike "Sly Flourish" Shea created the most widely adopted prep framework. The
framework requires approximately 30 minutes of prep for a 4-hour session.

The eight steps are:

1. Review the characters by examining player backgrounds, mechanics, goals,
   and personal arcs.

2. Create a strong start that opens with momentum through combat, mystery,
   or drama.

3. Outline potential scenes by brainstorming 3-5 likely scenes or locations.

4. Write secrets and clues by preparing 10 pieces of information that matter
   to the characters or reveal world history.

5. Describe fantastic locations by writing 2-3 evocative locations with
   sensory details.

6. List important NPCs with their motivations and key traits.

7. Prepare relevant monsters with stat blocks and tactics.

8. Consider magic items and rewards that advance story or character goals.

### The Three Clue Rule

For mystery and investigation scenarios, GMs should include at least three
clues for each conclusion the players need to reach.

The following clue types help ensure players can find information:

- Passive clues are those the players find through investigation, such as a
  letter hidden in a desk.

- Reactive clues require specific actions from the players, such as asking
  the right NPC the right question.

- Dynamic clues are those the GM creates on the fly in response to player
  actions.

- Proactive clues come to the players directly, such as when an assassin
  attacks the group.

### The Five Room Dungeon

The Five Room Dungeon provides a flexible framework for single-session
adventures.

| Room | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Entrance/Guardian | A challenge before the main adventure begins |
| Puzzle/Roleplay | A thinking or social challenge |
| Trick/Setback | A complication or unexpected twist |
| Climax | The main conflict or battle |
| Resolution | A reward, revelation, or hook for the next adventure |

### Fronts and Threats

The Apocalypse World system introduced fronts as a method for tracking
ongoing dangers that develop between sessions.

Each front contains the following components:

- Threats are active dangers in the world.

- Countdown clocks provide visual progress toward bad outcomes.

- Stakes questions are uncertainties the GM wants to answer through play.

- Fundamental scarcity is the core drive such as hunger, fear, or ambition.

Fronts advance when players do not actively oppose the threats.

### Progress Clocks

Blades in the Dark uses progress clocks to visualize ongoing situations.

| Clock Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Danger Clock | The clock tracks a mounting threat |
| Progress Clock | The clock tracks advancement toward a goal |
| Racing Clocks | Two opposed clocks compete against each other |
| Linked Clocks | One clock unlocks when another fills |
| Faction Clocks | Long-term faction goals advance over time |

Clocks typically have 4, 6, or 8 segments. The GM fills segments when the
situation progresses.

## Session Structure

### Session Zero

The session zero is a pre-campaign session that establishes expectations.

The session zero covers the following topics:

1. The GM presents the campaign pitch and setting overview.

2. The group discusses tone and style expectations.

3. The group establishes safety tools such as X-Card or Lines and Veils.

4. Players create characters collaboratively with connections between them.

5. The group addresses scheduling and logistics.

6. The GM explains house rules and system choices.

7. Players share their expectations and goals.

### Scene Framing Techniques

GMs use various techniques to open and close scenes effectively.

Opening techniques include:

- Cut to the Chase starts the scene in the middle of action.

- In Media Res begins at a dramatic moment.

- Threshold Framing cuts to just before the action begins.

Closing techniques include:

- Hard Cut ends the scene abruptly at a dramatic moment.

- Cliffhanger ends the scene before the resolution.

The key principle is to cut into scenes late and cut out of scenes early.

## Post-Session Practices

### Session Recap

GMs should capture the following information immediately after each session.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| What Happened | A brief summary of events |
| Player Decisions | The key choices the players made |
| Consequences | What should change in the world |
| Discoveries | What the players learned |
| Open Questions | Unresolved matters |
| Next Session Hooks | Where to start next time |

### Entity Updates

After each session, the GM updates affected entities.

| Update Type | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| Status changes | An NPC is injured or a location is destroyed |
| Relationship shifts | A faction alliance forms |
| Knowledge reveals | A secret is discovered |
| Location changes | A new area is mapped |
| Item transfers | An object is given or taken |

### Discovery State Tracking

The following states track what players know about entities.

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Unknown | The players have no knowledge of the entity |
| Mentioned | The players know the name or existence |
| Met | The players had direct interaction |
| Known | The players have significant information |
| Understood | The players have full understanding |

## System-Specific Patterns

### Call of Cthulhu

Keepers (Call of Cthulhu GMs) focus their preparation on the following areas:

- Handouts and props are central to gameplay and enhance immersion.

- Investigation structures require multiple clue paths to avoid dead ends.

- NPC relationships and secrets drive the narrative.

- Sanity-affecting revelations require careful pacing.

- Backup investigators help address the high lethality of the system.

### GURPS

GURPS GMs focus their preparation on the following areas:

- The Campaign Planning Form establishes detailed world parameters.

- Character review ensures point totals, advantages, and disadvantages are
  correct.

- Skill challenges must be appropriate to party capabilities.

- Combat encounter balance is critical because GURPS combat is lethal.

### Blades in the Dark

Blades in the Dark GMs focus their preparation on the following areas:

- Score opportunities should offer 2-3 available options at any time.

- Faction clock updates reflect the ongoing machinations of various groups.

- Entanglement tables are ready for use after each score.

- Devil's Bargains offer tempting complications to players.

## Practical Checklists
