}
```

}
```

## Campaign Organization

### Recommended Structure

```
Campaign
├── Core NPCs (10-20)
│   ├── Allies
│   ├── Antagonists
│   └── Neutral

│   ├── Safe havens
│   └── Dangerous places
├── Major Factions (3-5)
├── Important Items (5-10)
├── Active Clues (varies)

```

### Tagging Strategy

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `core` | Essential entities |
| `arc-1`, `arc-2` | Story arcs |
| `player-known` | Discovered by players |
| `deceased` | Dead NPCs |
| `destroyed` | Lost items/locations |
| `active` | Currently relevant |

## Best Practices

### Session Preparation

1. **Review previous session**
   Read actual notes from last session

2. **Update entity status**
   Reflect consequences in entities

3. **Plan flexible scenes**
   Prepare scenes, not scripts

4. **Prepare NPCs**
   Have stats and motivations ready

5. **Queue clues**
   Multiple paths to information

### Post-Session

1. **Record immediately**
   Write actual notes while fresh

2. **Update discoveries**
   Mark what players learned

3. **Track consequences**
   Note what should change

4. **Link timeline events**
   Create timeline entries

5. **Flag conflicts**
   Note any contradictions

### Long-Term Management

1. **Regular reviews**
   Check for stale information

2. **Resolve conflicts**
   Don't let conflicts accumulate

3. **Update relationships**
   Relationships change over time

4. **Archive completed arcs**
   Move finished content

5. **Backup regularly**
   Protect campaign data
